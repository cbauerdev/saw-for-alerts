# SAW for Alerts

## Simple Autonomous Web Components for Alerts

This repository contains a prototype library for web components designed to provide customizable alerts that can be easily integrated into software applications.

### How to Initialize

To begin development, you'll need a live server environment. If you're using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server plugin, simply right-click on the `index.htm` file and select "Open with Live Server".

### How to Use

To incorporate the alert components into your project, follow these steps:

1. Place the `webcomponents` folder into the directory of the component that will utilize these web components.
2. Utilize different components in your template:

- `<language-switcher>`: Choose between German and English (Work in Progress).

- `<alert-danger>`: Display a simple alert message for error notifications.

Feel free to edit the template and CSS to match your preferences, but avoid altering CSS classes or the code might fail to function properly.

Please note that this is an early prototype, hastily put together during a slow morning.
